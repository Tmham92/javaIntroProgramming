## assignment details ##
For this assignment you will need to get user input. In Java this can be achieved (amongst other means) by using the Scanner class to read from the console, like so:
```Java
Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);  
System.out.print("SAY SOMETHING: ");  
String input = keyboard.nextLine();  
System.out.println("INPUT=" + input);  
```
