## Learning outcomes
* Getting to know collection types 


## Assignment 

1. In this package you will find class `FindTheRightCollection`. 
It has a few methods that should all return a class - the class of the correct 
class. The Javadoc above the method will describe what should be returned.
The first case is already implemented so you get the gist.
The JUnit tests will tell you if the solutions are OK.

2. Implement the following use case.   
In the `data` folder, you will find a csv called `Clements-Checklist-v2018_sel.csv`. This file holds some information on all known bird species of the world. Here are the first few lines:

```
