# Interfaces

## Learning outcomes
* Getting to know interfaces 


## Assignment 

In this package you will find an interface called `StringCombinable` that has a single method: 
`String combine(String first, String second)`.

The other class in this package is `CombinerFactory` which has three factory methods for `StringCombiner` 
implementations. A factory method means the method serves a specific implementing class of the interface
but client code does not need to know this class, only that the interface has been implemented.

It is your task to create the described implementers according to the Javadoc comments of the three methods.
The JUnit tests will tell you if the solution is OK.
